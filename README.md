# Kii Cloud Plugin for Cordova/ Monaca

## For Cordova users
You can add this plugin in your app with the following command.

```sh
cordova plugin add https://github.com/KiiPlatform/kii-cordova-plugin
```

With the [sample app] (https://github.com/KiiPlatform/cordova-plugin-sample) you can try it quickly.

## For Monaca users
Please refer to README-monaca.md

Basically you don't need to work with this github repository
after our Monaca external plugin(外部サービス連携) has been released.

In case you need to work with the repository,
please checkout tag named monaca-{version}.
(Where version is x.y.z indicates version number)
Since there's Cordova version difference between Cordova and Monaca.

With the [sample app] (https://github.com/KiiPlatform/monaca-plugin-sample) you can try it quickly.
